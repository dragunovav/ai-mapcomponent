An early version of the html+javascript that will power the App Inventor map
component.

I am trying to avoid all extra work for our users having to sign the app (needed
when using the Android SDK) and instead using the JavaScript API (it only needs
an API Key).

The code is purposely built in one file, as it will be loaded into an Android
WebView. This view has an interface for two way communication between Java and
JavaScript, so the JavaScript in this file can be augmented with values from
Java, and the Java side can also interact with the JavaScript.

More coming soon.
